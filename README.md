## Credential Shield Protocol (CSP): An Open-Source, Server-Blind Protocol for Continuous Password Audits


## Executive Summary


Credential Shield Protocol (CSP) solves a critical, neglected enterprise security control: ongoing credential auditing.

Modern regulations (NIST, ISO) mandate continuous monitoring for breached passwords, but checking existing credentials is considered "tricky and expensive" to implement. CSP makes it feasible through a privacy-first architecture.


## Core Innovation: CSP enables organizations to audit password hashes against breach lists without:


a. Creating new sensitive data liabilities or query logs.

b. Insecurely solving the "hash mismatch" problem (Argon2 vs. SHA-1/NTLM).

c. Building expensive, custom infrastructure.

Think of CSP not as a product, but as the standard plumbing that turns a mandated control into operational reality.

## How CSP Works: Server-Blind Architecture


CSP uses a simple, cryptographic protocol to check passwords without exposing them:

1. Hash Locally - Your system hashes the password with its strong algorithm (Argon2, bcrypt). The full hash never leaves your environment.

2. Send a Non-Reversible Token - Your system sends only a short, non-reversible prefix of the hash to the CSP server.

3. Receive Anonymous List - The CSP server returns a small, anonymous list of all breach-list hashes that share that prefix.

4. Verify Locally & Privately - Your system checks locally if its full hash matches any in the list. The CSP server never learns the result.

This "server-blind" design is why CSP is uniquely suited for enterprise adoption—it creates no new data liability.

CSP is for: Organizations that can't send data to the cloud, need verifiable open-source code, or require continuous rather than one-off checks.


## For Security Leaders & Architects


Review our Protocol Specification and Technical Whitepaper to understand how CSP integrates with modern identity systems (Entra ID, Okta, etc.).
For Developers & Engineers

The protocol is designed for integration. Explore the reference implementations:

1. API Server Reference (Node.js)

2. Core Protocol Library (JavaScript)


## Initial Proof of Concept


Our first working demo, built in 24 hours, proved the core "server-blind" concept. You can try it here:
Live Demo: https://iamaxolotl-04.github.io/password-smoke-detector/

*Note: This demo uses a simulated breach database. A production system connects to extensive, updated breach data.


## Roadmap & Vision


Our focus is on building CSP into a robust, peer-reviewed standard.

Q1 2025: Formal protocol specification v1.0 & cryptographer peer review.

Q2 2025: Production-ready reference implementations (Go, Rust).

Q3 2025: Integration guides for major identity providers (Entra ID, Okta plugins).

 Long-term: Community adoption as the standard method for private credential audits.


## Contributing & Feedback


We are actively seeking collaboration from:

1. Cryptographers & Security Researchers for protocol analysis.

2. Enterprise Security Teams to validate requirements and use cases.

 3. Open-Source Developers to build robust implementations.


## Ways to engage:


1. Review the Whitepaper and provide feedback.

2. Try the Demo and report issues.

3. Start a Discussion about integration or use cases.
